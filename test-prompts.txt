Title: Poems by Poe, Author: Edgar Allen Poe. It was many and many a year ago, In a kingdom by the sea, That a maiden there lived whom you may know   By the name of Annabel Lee; And this maiden she lived with no other thought Than to love and be loved by me. I was a child and she was a child,    In this kingdom by the sea, But we loved with a love that was more than love—    I and my Annabel Lee— With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven Coveted her and me. 


Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a decentralized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality and all racially motivated violence against Black people. While Black Lives Matter can primarily be understood as a decentralized social movement, an organization known simply as Black Lives Matter exists as a decentralized network with about 16 chapters in the United States and Canada. The broader movement and its related organizations typically advocate against police violence towards black people, as well as for various other policy changes considered to be related to black liberation.

Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound with the chemical formula NH4NO3. It is a white crystalline solid consisting of ions of ammonium and nitrate. It is highly soluble in water and hygroscopic as a solid, although it does not form hydrates. It is predominantly used in agriculture as a high-nitrogen fertilizer. Global production was estimated at 21.6 million tonnes in 2017. Its other major use is as a component of explosive mixtures used in mining, quarrying, and civil construction. It is the major constituent of ANFO, a popular industrial explosive which accounts for 80% of explosives used in North America; similar formulations have been used in improvised explosive devices.

It is a well-known fact that matter does not vanish, rather it changes form, e.g. it changes from liquid to gas. Many of these natural elements have a great amount of hidden energy. Should this energy be harnessed and released, many things can be achieved if utilised correctly. The process of changing this energy from one form to another can be called an explosion. This takes place when we release this inner hidden energy in a sudden and prompt manner, to have an effect on the surrounding atmosphere. Therefore we can say that the explosive is a prompt release of energy, but not every prompt release of energy is an explosion.

Scar tissue that I wish you saw, Sarcastic mister know it all, Close your eyes and I'll kiss you, 'Cause with the birds I'll share, , With the birds I'll share this lonely view, With the birds I'll share this lonely view, , Push me up against the wall, Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra, Fallin' all over myself, To lick your heart and taste your health, 'Cause with the birds I'll share this lonely view, , With the birds I'll share this lonely view, With the birds I'll share this lonely view, , Blood loss in a bathroom stall, A southern girl with a scarlet drawl, Wave good-bye to ma and pa, 'Cause with the birds I'll share, , With the birds I'll share this lonely view, With the birds I'll share this lonely view, , Soft spoken with a broken jaw, Step outside but not to brawl and, Autumn's sweet we call it fall, I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and, And with the birds I'll share this lonely view
